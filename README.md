#Darwin

I realised there were a lot of things that I do manually on my machine. At the same exact moment, I realised that my Golang knowledge was awful. It's not a big leap to work out what happened next.

## Installation

In the scripts folder is a `build-and-install.sh`. Make sure you run it from within the scripts folder!

## Usage

Darwin is talkative, once installed just ask him 

```
darwin "What can you do?"
```

He'll tell you everything you need to know.

## Disclaimer

There is absolutely no warranty or liability with this technology. I built it to make my life easier but I thought I'd put it up on Github because... well why not. If this is the Facebook for developers, this is a bit like me uploading a picture of my brunch. Trashy, but everyone's doing it.

## Limitations

It relies on Applescript for some of the functionality so this is only going to play nice with MacOS.
